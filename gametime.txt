Which of the following is the benefits using triggers in database management system?"	MCQ	Faster application development. Because the database stores triggers, you do not have to code the trigger actions into each database application.	Global enforcement of business rules. Define a trigger once and then reuse it for any application that uses the database.	Easier maintenance. If a business policy changes, you need to change only the corresponding trigger program instead of each application program.	Improve performance in client/server environment.
